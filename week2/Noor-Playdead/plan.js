/* okay so what i want ot be able to do for the playdead website is to be able
to create an image through photshop of the two games, inside and i think its light,
or some shit like that . anyway, they will be side to side with like a white line
in the middle. i want to beable to have a function, that when it hovers over any of the pics, there 
will be a gif of the gameplay. i also want a white line in the middle. i feel like that would look hella sick, esp
with like aneautral background since both of games are hella dark!
when you click on either of the opictures, everything from the page disappears. i think i can do that using
the append and delte methods for the jquery shit that we learned today. anyway. once i do that 
the description of the game will op up. i want the description to just be a paragraph and i want
it to be short and meaninful. there will be a navigation ar at the top
it will not be the shitty navigation bar from bootstrap ust cuz fuck bootstrap and that shit is dumb hit!
i was one of the tabs to be an about. it will be an about for the company playdead. there will be another one
it will be a dropdown of the two games so that you dont have to go back to the homepage in order to view the games. 
it will call the same function that hides all the elements and then inserts the game one. 
i want this webstie to be fuckign awesome cuz so far my projects have been so shitty!
there will also be a logo on the naviagation bar so that it just refrehes the page and goes back to the home
oage. it will allow me to not have to refresh the page everytime i want to see the homepage


I NEED TO CODE ALL OF THIS SHIT BY SATURDAY NIGHT!!!!!
and actually fucking work on it you piece of shit!
